        <h2>Units and Sizes</h2>
        <p class="em-size">
          The <span>em</span> unit in CSS is realative unit of measurement. It's
          relative to the font-size of its parent element. This means that if
          you set the font-size of an element to 2em, it will be twice the size
          of its parent element's font-size. Em units are useful for creating
          scalable and responsive designs.
        </p>
        <p class="rem-size">
          The <span>rem</span> unit in CSS is similar to the em unit, but it is
          relative to the root element's font-size rather then the parent
          element;s font-size. This makes rem units particularly useful for
          establishing a consistent baseline across your entire document,
          especially in responsive designs.
