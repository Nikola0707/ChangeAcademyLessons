// Named Exports

// You can create named exports two ways. In-line individually, or all at once at the botton.

// In-line individually

export const name = "Stefan";
export let age = 25;

// All at once at the bottom
const fullName = "Nikola Ristoski";
const dob = "02-02-1999";

export { fullName, dob };
